Electric Vehicle Data Analysis
Overview
This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of electric vehicles. The analysis includes univariate and bivariate analysis, visualizations using Plotly, and the creation of engaging plots to present insights on electric vehicle trends.

Tasks Completed
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Conducted univariate and bivariate analysis to understand the dataset's structure and identify patterns.
Generated visualizations to illustrate findings.
Choropleth Map

Created a choropleth map using Plotly Express to display the number of electric vehicles based on location.
